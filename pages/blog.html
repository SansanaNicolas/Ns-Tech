        <h2>The Web3 Decentralization Debate Is Focused on the Wrong Question.</h2>
        <p>Web3 advocates promise decentralization on an unprecedented scale. Excessive centralization can stymie coordination and erode freedom, democracy, and economic dynamism—decentralization is supposed to be the remedy. But the term on its own is too vague to be a coherent end goal. Getting the job done takes the right kind of decentralization, and we worry that Web3 is thus far heading down the wrong track.</p>

        <h2>Ballooning US EV registrations raise opportunities for startups.</h2>
        <p>Electric vehicle volumes are soaring in the U.S. — with registrations up 60% in the first quarter of the year — even as the country's auto market contracted 18% as continued parts shortages constrained inventories.Between January and March, U.S. consumers registered 158,689 EVs, according to Experian. With EV volumes rising and automakers selling fewer fossil-fuel vehicles, EVs captured 4.6% of the market in the first quarter.</p>

        <h2>Uber adds electric vehicle ride option and drone delivery.</h2>
        <p>Uber announced a few big plans at its product event on Monday, including autonomous deliveries and the ability to specify if you want your ride to be an electric vehicle.
        Now, to be clear, these new features will not be rolling out to everyone right away. Uber rolled out its Comfort Electric program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Dubai, while promising it would add more cities soon. The feature lets riders choose an electric ride, similar to how you can order a larger vehicle (Uber XL) or a ride with your pet (Uber Pet).</p>

        <h2>Start up solo, or bring on a co-founder? 4 factors to consider.</h2>
        <p>Every journey to entrepreneurship is unique. I find the world of startups fascinating because the desire to address a problem or need — often one you've struggled with yourself — is just too tempting to resist.
        Taking on that problem on your own as a solo founder can be daunting, but it can also be freeing. Alternatively, starting up a company with co-founders can be productive yet could have its own challenges.</p>

        <h2>Elon Musk doubles down on support for this Twitter feature.</h2>
        <p>Several days after prospective Twitter owner Elon Musk suggested Twitter users switch their accounts to the latest-tweets feed instead of the algorithm-generated one, the billionaire entrepreneur hit the microblogging platform again on Sunday to repeat the advice. And also explain how to do it.
        By default, Twitter displays the algorithm-generated Home feed, which shows tweets that Twitter thinks you'll find most interesting according to your previous interaction with the app.  Content could include tweets from people you don't follow (beyond retweets), such as viral tweets and tweets linked to particular subjects that you've shown an interest in.</p>

        <h2>Apple iPhone 15: Release date, leaks, price, and more.</h2>
        <p>With over a year to go before the iPhone 15 sees the light of day, we're likely to hear a lot more as we get closer to 2023. Apple normally finalizes its designs about 10 months before the release of a new iPhone and locks them down for final production around January. So, by early 2023, we should be getting a much better idea of what the iPhone 15 will look like, but for now, it's important to keep in mind that even Apple likely hasn't yet made its final decision on the 2023 design.</p>

        <h2>QLED vs. OLED: Which TV technology is best?</h2>
        <p>As it stands, QLED and OLED panels make up a majority of the screens you'll find on today's leading flagship TVs. While many of us are already wading through a sea of TV-marketing acronyms, QLED and OLED are both hugely important when it comes to the kind of picture quality you'll be able to experience from the comfort of your living room.
        We'll discuss QLED versus OLED, where these competing display technologies come from, how they're different from each other, and what each one does well (and not so well). We'll also share which one we think most people will be happiest with. Spoiler: It's OLED TV — but with a few caveats you need to be aware of.</p>

        <h2>Nvidia RTX 40 GPUs could arrive sooner than anticipated.</h2>
        <p>As VideoCardz highlights, historically, Nvidia prefers to launch its high-end range of GPUs before the mid-range and entry-level variants. As such, the RTX 4090, 4080, and 4070 could be introduced next week at Computex, but only time will tell which cards hit store shelves first.
        As for the technical specifications of Team Green's next-gen boards, kopite7kimi summarized everything we've heard so far: The RTX 4090 in particular could feature 16,128 CUDA cores, 24GB of GDDR6X memory that is clocked at 21Gbps, a power draw of 450 watts, as well as being twice as fast as the RTX 3090.</p>
