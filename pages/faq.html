          <h2>What is <strong>Frontend development</strong>?</h2>
          <p>Front-end development is a style of computer programming that focuses on the coding and creation of elements and features of a website that will then be seen by the user.

          <h2>What is <strong>Backend development</strong>?</h2>
          <p>Back-end development focuses on the side of the website users can't see. It's what makes a site interactive. You can also refer to the back-end as the "server side" of a website. For example, let's say you're running a social media website, you need an accessible place to store all of your users information. This storage center is called a database and a few widely used examples include Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, etc. Databases are run form a server, which is essentially a remote computer, a Back-end developer will help manage this database as well as the site contents stored on it.</p>

Full stack web developers have the ability to design complete web applications and websites. They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web applications or websites. A  small independent game group made up of only a few people creating a small simulator could have one Back End Developer and one Front End Developer and that might be all they need for the development.
